# Fractal Pizza
 A game made in processing. It's your first day at fractal pizzaria! Customers will ask you for a certain fraction of the pizza. You make money if you deliver the correct amount, but lose money if you fail to select the right amount of slices. Finally, after a hard day of work, you can select get paid to see a summary of your days work.

## Instructions
To play the game you need Processing downloaded on your computer and to run the files as a sketch. All files in the FractalPizza folder are needed to play the game. By opening the fractalPizza file, the sketch should open all other files with it.

## Gameplay
The game starts with an order and a pizza. Your job is to click on the correct number of slices.

When you have selected the right amount of slices, you will deliver your pizza. If you selected the correct amount, you will earn some money. If you don't, you will lose some.

## Stages of Development
This game was made in a 6 hour time crunch two nights before robotics competition while my team was pulling an all-nighter working on our robot. I had to make an educational game for my game design class, and really wanted to make some sort of restaurant themed game. My original idea had been to have players draw toppings onto a certain portion of the pizza, but I haven't had time to work on that yet.

Instead, I started with a much more basic game where you simply select a certain amount of slices. The hardest part of developing the game was programming the collisions for the slices (especially on so little sleep). Finally once the collisions worked, I slapped on a little summary and turned it in. 

I think the game was a fun practice in coding, but would be much better if players could draw on the toppings like I had initially planned. I'll try and work on that in the future.
