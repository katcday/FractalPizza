COMMENTS: I spent some extra time fixing some bugs that were found in class, and then the submission was closed, and so I'm turning it into late and otherwise. All game mechanics
 should be functional, but there might be some glitches with the text.
Reflection: This was a challenging game idea. At first I wanted to be able to draw on toppings for certain fractions of the pizza, but that wasn't possible due to time constraints.
After some thinking I decided to just make the player select a certain fraction of the pizza. I spent most of my times working on drawing a random pizza, and coding the collisions.
It required more trig than I was initially expecting. So, while the game might not be fun, you can click tiny little slivers of a circle!! If I had more time, I'd probably make the 
game more interactive.
